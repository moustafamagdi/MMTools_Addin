A lightweight and intuitive tool that automates the creation and update of a 3D section box between any two user-defined levels, with optional inward or outward offsets.
**Perfect for:**

* Quickly reviewing specific floors or vertical zones
* Navigating complex architectural or structural models
* Saving time when switching between level-based views

---

 📏 **2. Duct Fitting Area Calculator**

An essential tool for MEP engineers that automatically calculates the external surface area of duct fittings—regardless of their shape (rectangular, round, oval, or custom).
**Key features:**

* Accurate fitting area calculation without relying on formulas or approximations
* Supports most fitting types, including custom shapes
* Saves the calculated value into a parameter of your choice
* Ideal for quantity takeoffs, insulation area estimation, and sheet metal weight calculations
